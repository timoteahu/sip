# SIP Neural Networks Project

This repository contains a small project developed as part of the **Science Internship Program (SIP)**. The focus of this project is implementing and experimenting with neural networks, using the MNIST dataset for handwritten digit recognition.

## Overview

This project explores:
- Fundamental concepts of neural networks.
- Implementation of a simple feedforward neural network in Python.
- Training and testing on the MNIST dataset to classify handwritten digits.
